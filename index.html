                    The most important thing is motivation -- this is what you need to achieve this double. If I win
                    just another grand tour
                    it’s not going to change my career but if I achieve the double this is something people are going to
                    remember, I take a
                    lot of motivation from this.

                            Velasco</a> (born <time>6<sup>th</sup>
                            December 1982</time>) is a Spanish former professional cyclist.
                        He is one of the most successful riders of his era, winning the Tour de France twice <b>(2007,
                            2009)</b>,
                        the Giro d'Italia twice <b>(2008, 2015)</b>, and the Vuelta a España three times <b>(2008, 2012,
                            2014)</b>. He is
                        one of
                        only seven riders to have won all three Grand Tours of cycling, and one of only two riders to have
                        won all three
                        more
                        than once. He has also won the Vélo d'Or a record 4 times.<br>

                        He was regarded as the natural successor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Armstrong"
                            target="_blank">Lance Armstrong</a> and won the 2007 Tour de France with the Discovery

                        the 2008 Vuelta a España and the 2009 Tour de France. Between 2007 and 2011 he won six consecutive
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Tour_(cycling)" target="_blank">Grand Tours</a> that he
                        entered.
                        This included winning the 2010 Tour de France with Astana, although it later emerged that he had
                        tested positive for
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clenbuterol" target="_blank">clenbuterol</a> during the race.
                        After along battle in court, he was suspended by the Court of Arbitration for Sport and stripped of
                        his 2010 Tour
                        and 2011 Giro wins.<br>

                        known for being
                        able to turn races around to his favour, most notably during the Fuente

                        the Giro once
                        more.

                        Amidst the clenbuterol controversy, Contador earned his first win
                        in the Vuelta a Murcia. He won the overall classification as well as two
                        stage victories en route to his victory. Later in the month of March,
                        Contador entered in the Volta a Catalunya, where he claimed a win on the third
                        stage to Vallnord, maintaining his advantage until the end of the race.
                        He also won the individual time trial of Vuelta a Castilla y León
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-light">
                        Contador started his season with still no verdict in the clenbuterol case.
                        He finished second overall in the Tour de San Luis and he won both uphill finishes,
                        only falling short in the time trial stage of the race. On <time>6<sup>th</sup> February</time>
                        he was stripped
                        of these early results, the 2010 Tour de France and 2011 Giro d'Italia wins and
                        many other victories. He was also suspended until <time>5<sup>th</sup> August</time> .On
                        <time>8<sup>th</sup> June</time> Contador rejoined Saxo
                        Bank–Tinkoff Bank upon the completion of his ban, signing a
                        contract that would keep him with the team until the end of the 2015 season
